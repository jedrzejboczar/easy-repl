# easy-repl

An easy to use REPL, ideal when there is a need to crate an ad-hoc shell.

This is a Rust library that provides a fast and convenient way to generate a
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
for your application. It comes with easy to use `command!` macro that
will automatically validate and parse command arguments, doing all the type
checking for you. The REPL comes with handy help messages, input validation,
hints and TAB-completion. Many REPL features can be configured.

See the crate documentation and the `examples/` directory for more information.
